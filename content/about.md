title: About me
---

I am a postdoctoral researcher at CASUS-HZDR (Germany), studying animal-road interactions and movement ecology study design. My PhD was based in Thailand, working on the spatial-temporal patterns of wildlife-vehicle collisions in a Thai biodiversity hotspot, with a secondary focus on bat communities. I am particularly interested in community ecology, movement ecology, and road ecology.
