title: About me
---

I am a *postdoctoral researcher* in the **Earth System Science** group at the Center for Advanced Systems Understanding (CASUS), located in Görlitz, **Germany**. I have a background spanning animal movement, road ecology and community ecology projects in Southeast Asia and South America. I am particularly interested in how animal movement is influenced by anthropogenic impacts, such as animal-road interactions and wildlife-vehicle collisions, study design and facilitating the uptake of new methods in movement ecology.

My PhD was based in **Thailand**, working on the spatial-temporal patterns of wildlife-vehicle collisions in the Dong Phayayen‐Khao Yai World Heritage Site -- a biodiversity hotspot located in Northeastern Thailand.
